# Natural Language Processing 1

## The course
This repository contains the two notebooks of the Natural Language Processing 1 course, taught at the University of Amsterdam for the master AI programme. The first notebook takes a deep dive into sentiment detection in movie reviews using a lexicon-based approach, a Naive Bayes and a Support Vector Machines approach. In the second lab, neural models are used to create sentence representations. Together with this lab a research into sentiment classification using neural models was performed. This report can be found in the Lab2 folder.
